# Carotid Stenosis NLP Extraction System

A natural language processing system for extracting carotid stenosis-related clinical variables from medical text, specifically radiology reports and clinical notes.

## Overview

This system identifies and extracts:
- **Qualitative stenosis severity** (mild, moderate, severe, etc.)
- **Quantitative percentages** (50-69%, 70-99%, etc.)
- **Peak systolic velocity ratios** (ICA/CCA ratios)
- **Anatomical references** (internal carotid artery, common carotid artery)
- **Laterality information** (left, right, bilateral)

## Features

- **Dual Pipeline Architecture**: Separate pipelines for qualitative/percentage extraction and ratio extraction
- **UIMA-based Processing**: Built on Apache UIMA framework using the Leo NLP library
- **Configurable Annotation Patterns**: Regex and pattern-based entity recognition
- **Post-processing Logic**: Combines multiple extraction types for comprehensive results
- **Flexible Output**: Supports database, CSV, and XMI output formats

## Prerequisites

- Java 8+
- Maven 3.6+
- Apache UIMA framework
- Leo NLP library dependencies

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CarotidStenosis
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Configure your data source**
   - Edit configuration files in `config/readers/` directory
   - Update database connections or file paths as needed
   - See `config/readers/FileCollectionReaderConfig.groovy` for file-based processing

4. **Run the pipeline**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="gov.va.vinci.StenosisService"
   ```

## Configuration

### Input Sources
The system supports multiple input sources:
- **File-based**: Process text files from a directory
- **Database**: Connect to SQL databases for batch processing
- **Streaming**: Real-time processing via UIMA AS

### Output Formats
- **Database**: Direct database insertion with configurable schema
- **CSV**: Structured output for analysis
- **XMI**: UIMA standard format for further processing

## Sample Data

The `data/input/` directory contains synthetic medical notes that demonstrate the types of text the system can process. These examples show:
- Radiology reports with carotid stenosis findings
- Clinical notes with vascular assessments
- Various reporting styles and terminology

## Documentation

- See `src/ReadMe.md` for detailed pipeline documentation
- Configuration examples in `config/` subdirectories
- Type system definitions in `src/main/java/gov/va/vinci/TypeSystem.java`
