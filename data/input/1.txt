Radiology Report - Carotid Duplex Study
Date: [SYNTHETIC DATA]
Patient ID: SAMPLE001

CLINICAL INDICATION:
Evaluation for carotid stenosis in patient with history of hypertension and dyslipidemia.

TECHNIQUE:
Bilateral carotid duplex sonography was performed including grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the common carotid arteries, internal carotid arteries, and external carotid arteries.

FINDINGS:

RIGHT CAROTID SYSTEM:
- Common carotid artery: Normal wall thickness, no significant plaque
- Internal carotid artery: Mild heterogeneous plaque causing approximately 30-40% stenosis
- Peak systolic velocity in ICA: 125 cm/sec
- ICA/CCA ratio: 1.8
- External carotid artery: Patent

LEFT CAROTID SYSTEM:
- Common carotid artery: Mild wall thickening
- Internal carotid artery: Moderate calcified plaque causing 50-60% stenosis
- Peak systolic velocity in ICA: 185 cm/sec
- ICA/CCA ratio: 2.4
- External carotid artery: Patent

VERTEBRAL ARTERIES:
Bilateral vertebral arteries demonstrate antegrade flow.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right ICA: Mild stenosis (30-40%)
2. Left ICA: Moderate stenosis (50-60%)
3. No hemodynamically significant stenosis identified

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Clinical correlation and follow-up as appropriate. Consider medical management for cardiovascular risk factors.
